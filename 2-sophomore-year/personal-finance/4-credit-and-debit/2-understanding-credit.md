# Understanding Credit

## credit cards

### payment options
* cash or check (pay full amount at time of purchase)
* debit card (must have money in bank)
* credit card (borrowing money, billed later and charged interest)

### borrowing money
* credit = ability to borrow money when you need it
* credit card = issued by financial institution, allows you to borrow money for purchases
* credit limit = set by bank, maximum amount of money that can be borrowed
* fees: annual interest rate (0-29%), late fees (upto $25), annual fee (right to use card over the course of the year, $18-$500)

### credit history
#### building good credit
* never miss payment
* make on-time payments
* pay atleast minimum amount
* only borrow what can be easily repaid
#### building bad credit
* miss payments
* make payments after due date
* pay less than minimum amount
* have too much debt
* default on loan (stop paying completely)

### credit report
* detailed written document about a person's credit history
* three credit bureaus collect and organize information
* three credit bureaus
    1. TransUnion
    2. Equifax
    3. Experian
* information collected and organized
    * personal information
    * public record
    * collection agency (reported if payments not in order)
    * credit accounts
    * inquiries (made by public institutions)

### credit scores
* numerical rating that shows how good a person's credit is
* range from 300 to 850
* scores are based on
    * payment history
    * amount of debt
    * types of credit
    * length of credit history
    * new credit
* score representation
    * 300 - 560 : bad or no credit
    * 560 - 660 : fair
    * 660 - 725 : good
    * 725 - 760 : very good
    * 760 - 850 : excellent
* high credit score => lower risk => lower interest
* low credit score => high risk => higher interest
#### improving credit score
* using credit only when you need it
* making on-time payments
* having long history of good credit
* having low overall debt
* keeping credit card balances < 70% of limits
* paying off loans early
