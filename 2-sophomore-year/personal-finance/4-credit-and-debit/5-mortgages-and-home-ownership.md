## types of mortgages

### fixed rate
* most common type of mortgage
* interest rate stays constant through life of loan
* outside economy does not affect interest rate or monthly payments
#### calculating fixed-rate mortgage monthly payment
* P = principal
* R = monthly interest rate
* n = total number of monthly payments
* M = monthly payments
* M = P ( [R (1 + R)<sup>n</sup>] / [(1 + R)<sup>n</sup> - 1] )
#### pros of fixed-rate mortgage
* interest stays the same over the entire term
* monthly payments are predictable
* if interest rates rise on market, borrower benefits by keeping lower rate
#### cons of fixed-rate mortgage
* if interest rates fall on market, borrower is stuck paying higher rate

### adjustable rate

* lenders give borrowers lower initial interest rates
* drop in interest rates could mean lower monthly payments
#### cons of adjustable-rate mortgages
* rise in interest rates would mean higher monthly payments
* hgiher monthly payments could mean larger overall payments

### balloon payment mortgages
* majority of the principal is due in one payment
* borrower agrees to make regular payments for short-term (between five and ten years)
* borrower pays interest and repays some of the principal
* at end of term, remaining principal is due immediately
#### pros of balloon payment mortgages
* allow borrower to postpone some of the expense of buying house
* good choice for borrower who plans to sell home before term is over
