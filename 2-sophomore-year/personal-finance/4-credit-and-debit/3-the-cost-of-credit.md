* grace periods (accrue interest charges)
* rewards program (discounts)
#### repaying
* APR (annual percentage rate)
    * annual interest rate charged for borrowing money from an institution
    * unpaid balances during each billing cycle will cause you to have to pay interest on that money
    * divide by 12 to calculate % of unpaid balance in each billing cycle
* pay full balance each month 
    * minimum balance payments

### choosing and repaying closed-end credit
#### choosing
* lowest interest rate
    * fixed rate (do not change during the course of loan)
    * variable rate (change based on banking rates set each year)
* amount of down payment required
* additional fees
#### repaying
* occurs over long periods of time (typically 5 years for car loan and 30 years for home loan)
* when taking out closed-end loan, each payment will be part principal and part accrued interest
* to calculate monthly payment for loan, consider
    * amount borrowed
    * interest rate
    * term of loan
