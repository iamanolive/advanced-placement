# Investing and Financial Markets

## macroeconomics
* how the whole economy is performing
* firms sell goods and services to households
* households sell factors of production to firms
* factors of production = land, labor, capital
* households save or invest money (leakage from circular flow) 
* money gets reinjected into circular flow when money is removed for spending
* investments and loans lead to less total spending

## investing

    1. make initial investment by spending money
    2. allow investment to mature over time
