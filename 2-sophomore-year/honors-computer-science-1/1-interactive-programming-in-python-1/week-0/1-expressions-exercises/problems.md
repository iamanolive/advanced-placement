# Practice Exercises for Expressions

Solve each of the practice exercises below. Each problem includes three CodeSkulptor links: one for a template that you should use as a starting point for your solution, one to our solution to the exercise, and one to a tool that automatically checks your solution.  

1. There are 5280 feet in a mile. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of feet in 13 miles.

2. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of seconds in 7 hours, 21 minutes and 37 seconds

3. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2w + 2h, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the length in inches of the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches.

4. The area of a rectangle is wh, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly in this formula. This is standard practice in mathematics, but not in programming. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches.

5. The circumference of a circle is 2πr where r is the radius of the circle. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the circumference in inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π = 3.14.

6. The area of a circle is πr<sup>2</sup> where r is the radius of the circle. (The raised 2 in the formula is an exponent.) Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π = 3.14.

7. Given p dollars, the future value of this money when compounded yearly at a rate of r percent interest for y years is p(1 + 0.01r)<sup>y</sup>. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the value of 1000 dollars compounded at 7 percent interest for 10 years.

8. Write a single Python statement that combines the three strings "My name is", "Joe" and "Warren" (plus a couple of other small strings) into one larger string "My name is Joe Warren." and prints the result.

9. Write a Python expression that combines the string "Joe Warren is 52 years old." from the string "Joe Warren" and the number 52 and then prints the result (Hint: Use the function str to convert the number into a string.)

10. The distance between two points (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) and (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) is sqrt((x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>). Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the distance between the points (2, 2) and (5, 6).
