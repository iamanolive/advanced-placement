# The area of a rectangle is wh, where w and h are the lengths of its 
# sides. Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly 
# in this formula. This is standard practice in mathematics, but not 
# in programming. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints 
# the area in square inches of a rectangle with sides of length 4 
# and 7 inches.

l = 4
w = 7
area = l * w
print(area)
