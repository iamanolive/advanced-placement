# Practice Exercises for Variables and Assignments

Solve each of the practice exercises below. Each problem includes three CodeSkulptor links: one for a template that you should use as a starting point for your solution, one to our solution to the exercise, and one to a tool that automatically checks your solution.

1. Given a template that pre-defines a variable "miles", write an assignment statement that defines a variable "feet" whose value is the number of feet in "miles" miles.

2. Given a template that pre-defines three variables "hours", "minutes" and "seconds", write an assignment statement that updates the variable "total_seconds" to have a value corresponding to the total number of seconds for "hours" hours, "minutes" minutes and "seconds" seconds.

3. Given a template that pre-defines the variables "width" and "height" that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "perimeter" whose value is the perimeter of the rectangle in inches.

4. Given a template that pre-defines the variables "width" and "height" that are the lenghts of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "area" whose value is the area of the rectange in square inches.

5. Given a template that pre-defines the constant "PI" and the variable "radius" corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "circumference" whose value is the circumference of a circle with radius "radius" in inches.

6. Given a template that pre-defines the constant "PI" and the variable "radius" corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "area" whose value is the area of a circle wih radius "radius" in square inches.

7. Given the pre-defined variables "present_value", "annual_rate" and "years", write an assignment statement that defines a variable "future_value" whose value is "present_value" dollars invested at "annual_rate" percent interest, compounded annually for "years" years.

8. Given the pre-defined variables "first_name" and "last_name", write an assignment statement that defines the variable "name_tag" whose value is the string "My name is % %." where the percents should be replaced by "first_name" and "last_name". Note that, in Python, you can use the + operator on strings to concatenate (i.e. join) them together into a single string.

9. Given the pre-defined variables "name" (a string) and "age" (a number), write an assignment statement that defines a variable "statement" whose value is the string "% is % years old." where the percents should be replaced by "name" and the string form of "age".

10. Given the variables x0, y0, x1 and y1, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "distance" whose value is the distance between the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1).

11. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle is sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and s = 1/2(a + b + c) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. Given the variables x0, y0, x1, y1, x2 and y2, write a Python program that computes a variable "area" whose value is the area of the triangle with vertices (x0, y0), (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
