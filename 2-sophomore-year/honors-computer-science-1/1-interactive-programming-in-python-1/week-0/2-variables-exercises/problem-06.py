# Given a template that pre-defines the constant "PI" and the variable "radius" corresponding to the radius of a
# circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "area" whose value is the area of a
# circle wih radius "radius" in square inches.

PI = 3.14
radius = 8

area = PI * (radius ** 2)
print(area)
