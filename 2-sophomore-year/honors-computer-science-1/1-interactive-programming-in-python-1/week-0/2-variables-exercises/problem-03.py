# Given a template that pre-defines the variables "width" and "height" that are the lengths of the sides of a
# rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "perimeter" whose value is the perimeter of
# the rectangle in inches.

width = 4
height = 7

perimeter = (2 * height) + (2 * width)
print(perimeter)
