# Given a template that pre-defines the constant "PI" and the variable "radius" corresponding to the radius of a 
# circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "circumference" whose value is the 
# circumference of a circle with radius "radius" in inches.

PI = 3.14
radius = 8

circumference = 2 * PI * radius
print(circumference)
