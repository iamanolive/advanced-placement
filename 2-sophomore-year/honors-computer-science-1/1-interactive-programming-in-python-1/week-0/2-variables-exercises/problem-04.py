# Given a template that pre-defines the variables "width" and "height" that are the lenghts of the sides of a 
# rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable "area" whose value is the area of the 
# rectange in square inches.

width = 4
height = 7

area = height * width
print(area)
